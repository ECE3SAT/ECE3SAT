How to generate the binary :

-Create a mbed account and log in
-Go to https://developer.mbed.org/teams/ST/code/HelloWorld_IKS01A1/file/49650e8f0bb2/main.cpp and click on the right on "import into Compiler"
-Select the platform as asked, which is for us the NUCLEO-F401RE
-Chose the name of the folder
-Open the main.cpp and replace his content by the content of the main.cpp file of this github folder
-You can now click on "Compile" to generate the binary.

How to use the binary :

-When you plug the Nucleo on the usb port you can open it as if it was a usb stick. Then just copy-paste the binary inside (twice to make it work).
